Role
======
During my undergraduate degreee, there was a final capstone project during my final semester. This project 
involved finding a problem and designing a solution to this problem. I was part of a group with 2 other 
classmates. My role in the group was to help with programming the app in the project as well as setting up
some of the tools used to help with development.
