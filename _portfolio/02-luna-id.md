Role
======
During my undergraduate degreee, there was a final capstone project during my final semester. This project 
involved finding a problem and designing a solution to this problem. I was part of a group with 2 other 
classmates. Our group was partnered with a local start-up company whose goal was to develop an Android app
which could identify a species of insect based on a picture of it. Our group was involved with developing
a user-friendly Android app that would work with the insect identification already implemented by the start-up.
My role in the group was to help with programming the Android app and the user interface 
as well as setting up some of the tools used to help with development.

Problem
======
The start-up company was looking to create an app which would be able to identify an insect based on an
image. The company was working with a butterfly conservatory to build a prototype of their idea to identify
species of butterflies in the conservatory. The company already had a machine learning model that was able
to identify different species of butterflies from an image. The next problem to tackle for them was to 
develop an app that someone could easily use that would allow them to identify a butterfly based on their picture,
and would provide them information about the identified butterfly species.
