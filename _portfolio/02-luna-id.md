Role
======
During my undergraduate degreee, there was a final capstone project during my final semester. This project 
involved finding a problem and designing a solution to this problem. I was part of a group with 2 other 
classmates. Our group was partnered with a local start-up company whose goal was to develop an Android app
which could identify a species of insect based on a picture of it. Our group was involved with developing
a user-friendly Android app that would work with the insect identification already implemented by the start-up.
My role in the group was to help with programming the Android app and the user interface 
as well as setting up some of the tools used to help with development.
